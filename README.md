# AFC Python

Correspondence factor analysis (CFA) - or correspondence analysis
to simplify - offers a synthetic view of the information carried by a
contingency table. It allows you to quickly clear up large pictures.
Much of its power rests on the graphic representations it
offers.
They allow us to easily locate the attractions (repulsions) between the
modalities.
Technically, we can see AFC as a cloud adjustment method
row and column profiles, allowing their simultaneous representation, ie.
in the same reference.
We can also see it under the angle of the orthogonal decomposition of the
chi-square distance to independence. This prism is interesting because
that he clearly shows that before we look at the structure of the gaps, it is
very important to consider their importance and ask the question: are there any
the relevant information in the table to be analyzed? If the chi-square distance is
too weak, the study is illusory.
